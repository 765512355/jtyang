## About Me

I am an associate professor at China Agricultural University.  
My research focuses on the **sustainable transformation of agri-food systems**, with a particular emphasis on:

- Low-carbon rice production and distribution  
- Full-chain governance of cadmium pollution from soil to rice to human health  
- Biodiversity and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes  

I work at the intersection of **GIS, environmental science, and agricultural economics**, aiming to bridge scientific understanding and policy practice.

## Research Areas

### 1. Low-carbon agri-food systems

- Quantifying carbon, water, and land footprints embedded in interprovincial rice flows  
- Optimizing rice circulation networks via linear and multi-objective programming  
- Providing policy-relevant scenarios for achieving China’s “dual-carbon” goals  

### 2. Cadmium pollution along the soil–rice–human chain

- Spatial modeling of cadmium in rice and soils at regional and watershed scales  
- Probabilistic exposure assessment across demographic and income groups  
- Designing differentiated, place-based governance strategies  

### 3. Biodiversity & ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes

- Evaluating habitat quality and biodiversity impacts of agricultural policies  
- Case studies on rice–fish systems, wetland–paddy mosaics, and ecological restoration  
- Exploring synergies between food production, climate mitigation, and biodiversity conservation

## Methods & Tools

- **Spatial modeling**: GIS, Remote Sensing, GeoDetector, spatial autocorrelation and regression  
- **Optimization**: Linear programming, multi-objective optimization, heuristic algorithms (GA, ACO)  
- **Machine learning and forecasting**: Random Forest, LSTM / Seq2Seq for time series  
- **Ecosystem & risk models**: InVEST, DNDC, exposure assessment frameworks
