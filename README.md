## About Me
  
I am an Associate Professor at China Agricultural University, working at the intersection of GIS, environmental science, agricultural economics, and sustainability analytics.
I have served as the **Principal Investigator** for multiple competitive research fundings, including a **National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Young Scientist Project**, the **Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Sciences Fund**, the **China Postdoctoral Science Foundation**, the **National Program for Postdoctoral Innovative Talents**, and several **National Key Laboratory Open Funds** and **university-level interdisciplinary grants**. These fundings collectively support my long-term research agenda on **spatiotemporal process modeling** and the **sustainable transformation of agri-food systems**.

## My research centers on two major directions:

### 1. Spatiotemporal process modeling of agricultural–environmental systems

I develop spatially explicit models to understand how agricultural production, pollutant migration, ecological processes, and human behaviors evolve across space and time. I integrate GIS, remote sensing, spatial statistics, and system simulation to uncover heterogeneity, dynamics, and feedbacks within coupled human–environment systems. 

### 2. Optimization and governance of sustainable agri-food systems

I design optimization and policy frameworks to achieve low-carbon development, heavy-metal pollution governance, and biodiversity protection. My work quantifies environmental footprints embedded in interprovincial food circulation and proposes implementable solutions that support China’s dual-carbon goals, food safety strategies, and ecological compensation mechanisms.

Overall, my research aims to provide data-driven, model-supported, and polic
